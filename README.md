# asc-cpp

`asc-cpp` is a C++ embedding of [the AssemblyScript compiler](https://www.assemblyscript.org) made using [Binaryen](https://github.com/WebAssembly/binaryen) and [Wasmtime](https://wasmtime.dev).  While it was created for use in [Mondradiko](https://github.com/mondradiko/mondradiko), it is also intended as a general-purpose, self-contained solution for AssemblyScript scripting in C++ projects.

See [BUILDING.md](BUILDING.md) for build instructions.
